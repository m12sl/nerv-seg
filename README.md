# Kaggle Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation

Current status:
1. Docker almost ready: problems with opencv.
It's installed only for python2 via apt-get.
2. Model not tested
3. Train not ready

TODO:
1. Add opencv3 into Dockerfile
2. Test runnable

Solution code based on https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation solution.

Main idea: rich augmentation technics and model tuning: BN and so on.
